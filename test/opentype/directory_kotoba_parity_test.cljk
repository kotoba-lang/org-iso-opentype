;; `kotoba/opentype/directory.kotoba` against `opentype.core/parse`.
;;
;; Parity covers what the library reads and reads correctly: the sfnt
;; version, the table count, and which of head/maxp/name/cmap the directory
;; names. The fixture is the repo's own `noto-lycian.ttf`, so agreement is
;; against something neither side made up.
;;
;; Three places are where they part, and the test shows each rather than
;; describing it:
;;
;;   * `a-file-that-is-not-a-font-is-refused` -- `parse` reads a version of
;;     0xDEADBEEF and still answers `:magic-ok? true`, because it never
;;     looks at the version it just read;
;;   * `a-table-offset-past-the-end-is-refused` -- `:table-offsets` exists,
;;     in the library's own words, "so a caller can reach `opentype.cmap`
;;     without re-parsing the directory". An offset of 0xFFFFFFFF is handed
;;     to that caller with nothing said;
;;   * `an-oversized-table-count-is-refused-rather-than-thrown` -- a
;;     numTables of 0x7FFF produces an IndexOutOfBoundsException. A refusal
;;     and a raw exception are different answers, and only one of them a
;;     caller can act on.
;;
;; `.cljc` stays the oracle for the fields it extracts and is not required
;; from the guest (require-graph). It did not grow a second copy of these
;; refusals (ADR-2608261100).
