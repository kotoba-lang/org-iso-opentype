;; The gate that was missing: does the COMPILED artifact decide the way the
;; interpreter does?
;;
;; `directory_kotoba_test.clj` drives the guest through `kotoba.kir`, which
;; is not what ships. Until this file existed, nothing here had asserted
;; that `kotoba -M compile` produces something that answers the same way --
;; the shape this workspace keeps warning about, where a check that never
;; ran looks exactly like a check that passed.
;;
;; This guest is a STREAM, so the comparison is over whole WALKS: `init`,
;; the twelve-byte header, then a directory entry at a time. The probe hands
;; the guest's own returned state document straight back in; bytes the host
;; introduces go through the runtime's `typedValues.document` in the tagged
;; form the KIR value plane uses, and building one any other way is refused
;; as forged.
;;
;; ## Skipping is not passing
;;
;; The gate needs `kotoba`, `nbb` and an amu checkout. Each is measured by
;; RUNNING it and reading the exit code, never by `which` -- a shim whose
;; target is gone passes `which` and exits 126, which this migration has
;; already been bitten by. When a tool is absent the probe exits 3, which is
;; neither 0 nor 1, and this file reports the absence rather than asserting
;; nothing.
