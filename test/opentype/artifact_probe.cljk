;; Compile `kotoba/opentype/directory.kotoba` and run the COMPILED artifact.
;;
;; The JVM suite drives the guest through the KIR interpreter, which is not
;; the thing that ships. This runs the `.wasm` the public CLI produces, on
;; real `WebAssembly`, through amu's own `runtime/browser-host.mjs`, over
;; this repository's own `noto-lycian.ttf`, and prints what it answered so
;; `directory_artifact_test.clj` can hold it against the interpreter.
;;
;; nbb rather than a `.mjs`: this workspace does not add raw JavaScript
;; harnesses (CLAUDE.md, runtime priority).
;;
;; This guest is a STREAM -- `init`, the header, then one directory entry at
;; a time, each returning the next state -- so the probe hands the guest's
;; own returned document straight back in. Bytes the host introduces go
;; through `typedValues.document` in the tagged form the KIR value plane
;; uses; building one any other way is refused as forged.
;;
;; `take` and not `subvec` for the header: a truncated file has fewer
;; than twelve bytes, and a host that does not have them cannot offer them.
;; `subvec` past the end throws on the JVM and does not in ClojureScript, so
;; using it here would make the two halves of this gate disagree about the
;; HARNESS rather than about the runtimes.
;;
;; A whole walk shares ONE instance, because the state has to survive the
;; calls. That is why only the first few entries are offered: a module's
;; fuel is a private global baked in at compile time (512 by default) and is
;; spent over the life of an instance, so a ten-entry directory does not fit
;; in one. The suite walks the whole file on the interpreter; what is
;; compared here is the prefix both can do.
